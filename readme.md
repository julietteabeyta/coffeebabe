### Hey Babe

You've got this. Your PSD and resources needed are right here. Here's some tips:
- *Bootstrap*. Don't worry about making it responsive, but Bootstrap is super opinionated about _being_ responsive, so like why not, right?
- *Fontawesome*. All of the icons are Fontawesome. Yes, there are other icon fonts. Fontawesome is my favorite, and the most actively maintained IMO.
- Other fonts used were *Source Sans Pro*, *Montserrat*, and *Josefin Slab*. They're all on Google Fonts and can be included with their CDN if you want, and I would.
- If you have any questions about any of this, let me know and I'll take care of it.

_Also_:
- Push code often. In little pieces. If you have any problems with git, don't worry about it. Focus on building the site. I'm proud of you and you're wonderful and talented.
- It is easy to get caught up in perfectionism, especially if you're as perfect as YOU are. Just get it close, fine-tune it later.
- If anything holds you up (like the CSS pseudo elements on Testimonials or whatever), text your boyfriend. He'll help you cause he adores you.

#### Challenge:
Try to make any of the elements interactive with some jQuery. Even if that's just using a plugin that you think is cute, try to include a little bit of the ol jQ.
